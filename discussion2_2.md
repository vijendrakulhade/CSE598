Hyper ledger fabric documentation is very well organized. I found many interested topic like smart contract, consensus , peers, ledger, orderer, policies, channel.
Smart contract (Chaincode) is a way to interact with ledger and it is deployed into peers which execute these codes and update the ledger. Peer to peer connection happens via didicated or shared channel. 
I have gone through the tutorial and was able to setup hyperledger fabric network. We can create a new channel between peers to maintain the privacy, also chain code can be deployed to individual peers for specific channel. Deployed chaincode needs to be approved by the peers, before it can be committed. After commit we can invoke the chain code and update the ledger or query it. 
The concepts which I was am still struggling to understand is about orderer and endorsement policies. Also I couldn't find any details about couchbase db setup for worldstate, the default is leveldb which comes with hyperledger fabric, however it is not clear in the documentation to about the couchbase docker image.
